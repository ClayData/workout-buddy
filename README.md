# workout-buddy

### Use/comparison with existing apps:

Workout buddy is an application that allows you to create and run through home workouts. With gyms closed and lots of people doing home workouts, we wanted to make an application to make following a home workout easier. Users will not have to struggle setting timers on their phones or remembering which workouts to perform. There appears to be many mobile applications for following home workouts, but may of these are geared toward preset workouts. The disadvantage of running this on a mobile application is the relatively small size of phones. When you are doing a workout and moving around, it is not easy to read a phone screen. It would be advantageous to see the timer and workout routine on a larger screen and not have to pick up your phone to see instructions between each exercise.

### Function:

Users will be able to create and save custom workout routines with custom times per exercise. When they start their workout, a timer will begin indicating how much time is left for a particular exercise. When time is done, it will move on to the next exercise with a new timer.

Users will also be able to select preset workout for a "quick start" option. There will be options for preset 5 minute, 10 minute and 15 minute workouts.

The user page will also show a user what workouts they have performed recently and their saved workout routines. There will also be a graph to show them how much time they have spent per week working out.
